- ABOUT ME👋
Hello, my name is Christopher, my nickname is Stiles reference to a serial character I like and reference to css. I am currently in Dev Web & Web Mobile training with Online Forma PRO to have a bac + 2 level. I started in digital after a first training with Simplon. My interest has only grown since then and I hope to be able to do my job afterwards.
- MY INTERESTS👀
In my everyday life, I like to listen to music especially urban latin, indie pop or game soundtrack, especially the final fantasy or zelda made by glichxcity. I have been interested in gaming for several years, over time I focus mainly on FFXIV. I also like to collect sneakers, mainly that of nike which is a brand that I like.
